        Unfortunately this device does not have support for Bluetooth 4.0 which is a critical

        Unfortunately this device does not have extended Bluetooth LE Support.
        While the software features necessary for advtecertising as a peripheral are available from
        Lollipop on, manufacturers must also use a Bluetooth chip-set that can support advertisement.
        This is a critical hardware requirement and operations cannot persist without it.

        messages and organize data transfer. Please Be aware that Bluetooth LE has much lower energy
        usage than classic Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and as such will not have as noticeable of an impact
